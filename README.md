## Overview
This is a small fun project of mine which calculate the time taken to download a file and also emulates the downloading process in realtime. I know the idea is quite dumb but it helped me to learn about forms. Simple calculations are used for the project and the time interval of every simulation is 1s.

## Notes
- For the 'File Size' I only programmed 3 units (KB, MB, GB) because I didn't want to overcomplicate stuffs.
- For the 'Data Transfer Rate' I programmed only 3 units (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps) for the same reason and also they are the most used units.
- Clicking the 'start simulation' button while a simulation is running causes another instance to run resulting in weird issues. (BUG) (Solved)
